The game server (server.py) should be run first, and then each connected client will spawn on the map in a random location. The purpose is to shoot other players without dying.<br/>
<br/>
**Controls:** <br/>
*WASD to move* <br/>
*Space to shoot* <br/>
<br/>
**There are 3 types of power-ups**:<br/>
*Green: Extra health*<br/>
*Red: Bullet speed increase*<br/>
*Gray: Player speed increase*<br/>
<br/>
Rest of the game design can be found in ***game plan.pdf***.
